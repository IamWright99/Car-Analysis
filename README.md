# Car sales analysis
# This is a dataset I found on kaggle on car sales from models (from many different manufactures) existing between 2011 and 2012.

# The main point of my exploration is to do an analysis on what plays in to resale value of a car while also finding hidden variables that could play a part in a car's value 
# in buying and selling.

# I mainly have done data cleaning, analysis, and vizualization in R and Excel but this time i'm using pandas for cleaning and possibly  for analysis (haven't decided) then tableu for visualization
# for the purpose of furthering my skills

# Reason for choosing dataset?: I like cars :)

# Currently: I'm mainly done with the "tedious" cleaning of the data such as dealing with null values and seperating columns into their own columns for the purpose of analysis
# I plan to change column names and other minor "quality of life change" in the future (Trust me, I didn't forget. Work has been tiring me out lately lol)
